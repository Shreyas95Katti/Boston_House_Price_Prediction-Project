# Boston_House_Price_Prediction-Project

Hello guys!!!

The Boston house price prediction project is a highly intutive project. It allows you to explore basic and important machine learning concepts such as Data Visualization, Linear Regression and Robust Regreesion. These topics are the stepping stones to get into core machine learning projects. In the project we focus on single variable linear regression model. This is a supervised learning technique considering that we have a labeled dataset. The project starts with importing the required python libraries and and loading the dataset with appropriate changes. Then we visualize the dataset to observe the data points. This is done using two major data visualization techniques that are pairplot and heatmap. The next step involved is the usage of the linear regression model on the training and testing sub-dataset. We view how the linear regression predicts an accurate result by plotting the best fit curve which is done using the data visualization functions regplot and jointplot. Finally we repeat the same procedure for robust regression also

The major take away from this project is: Machine Learning is only 5 steps 

1)Import required libraries

2)Choose a model and apply necessary parameters

3)Arrange data into feature matrix and target matrix

4)Fit model fo give data

5)Apply for new data
